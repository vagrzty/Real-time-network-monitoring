This is a Python project for network monitoring. The reason for developing it is that I once had a dispute with my internet service provider
over network fluctuations, but I was left speechless after being refuted because I couldn't provide valid log records. So I asked AI to 
write this program. It uses the ping command to monitor network fluctuations in real-time in the background, generates log files in real-
time, and automatically adds a timestamp before each network status record to help determine the duration of network fluctuations. The 
entire program was mostly completed by AI, with almost no modifications from me.

这是一个用于网络监控的Python项目。开发起因是我曾因网络波动问题与运营商沟通，但由于拿不出有效的日志记录，被对方反驳得无言以对。于是我让AI编写了这
个程序，它通过ping命令在后台实时监控网络波动情况，同时实时生成日志文件，并且会在每条网络状态记录前自动添加时间戳，方便判断网络波动的持续时长。整
个程序基本由AI完成，我几乎没有做修改。
